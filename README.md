## Description

This is the text of master thesis at [FIT CTU in Prague](http://fit.cvut.cz/) written by [Martin Štekl](#author).

Final text will be completely in English however first notes are made in Czech for faster progress.

Original requirements can be found as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/stekycz/8482392).

The document begins in file [index.md](index.md).

## Requirements

Study the basics of testing, different methods, levels and types of testing, processes related to software testing and describe the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, levels and types of tests. Find and compare different tools that focus on testing RESTful API in the context of continuous integration or the description of the RESTful API. Based on these findings describe the differences and similarities in methods of testing code itself for regular SW and methods for testing RESTful API.

Study the syntax of the [API Blueprint](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint) language for describing RESTful API and study testing tool [Dredd](https://github.com/apiaryio/Dredd). Compare current testing possibilities using this tool to previously described methods and then propose possible changes and modifications to extend the capabilities of this tool.

Choose some of the proposed modifications and implement them. Propose implemented changes as Pull Requests on server [GitHub](https://github.com/) for merge in main repositories of this tool.
