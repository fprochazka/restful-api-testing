## Introduction

Last few years a new technology called _REST_ is growing up. This technology was described by Roy Fielding in year 2000 in his dissertation[[1](../README.md/#Fielding2000)]. It is mostly used around web where it found wide usability. The technology itself is called _REST_ however its implementation is called _RESTful_. The implementation is an API in this context. So the implementation can vary (and it do in real usage) however if basic principals of this technology are satisfied then an API can be called _RESTful_.

_RESTful API_ is only communication interface of some system or module as other API. The interface can be used by programmer for integration of programmer's system and a system which providers _RESTful API_. Similar integration is mostly known in field of corporations in which many specific systems comunicates togerther. The integration can be more powerful in field of web. It could be easier to build new service by combination of suitable _RESTful API_s similary to building general software using development libraries. However _RESTful API_ does not support functionality only but it also support data and information.

_RESTful API_ is used in almost all web applications today. It is typically used by social networks which have public API usable by everyone in general. _RESTful API_ is always public generally talking however you can find a situation in which is is not wanted. It is typically _RESTful API_ of company internal systems which functionality and data must be protected. It can be API for special mobile application and this API must not be used by anyone else. There exists some security mechanisms wbout which I will not talk about much in this thesis.


Neither it is public or private _RESTful API_ it is important to keep documentation and tests up to date. If the API is public then it should be always requirement. The more _RESTful API_s exists in the world the more development, documentation and testing tools arises. It is different programming style on different level then plain program code and so current tools for generating or testing software does not have to be suitable good enough. Unfortunately most tools are created for development but amount of documentation and testing tools is relatively low.

Although the _REST_ can be implemented in various ways it was originally established as a generalization of the HTTP protocol. I will focus on HTTP protocol in this thesis for descriptions and examples because it is the most common implementation of RESTful API in these days. I think the HTTP protocol is the preferred or only supported implementation of _REST_ because of preliminary tools analysis.

This thesis is not focused on documentation or description of _RESTful API_ however I will take a look for it too a little. The main topic of this thesis is testing of _RESTful API_. Documentation and description of API can be created in simple text editor if it is needed. The only thing you need is a set of conventions and rules. Testing is not good to simlify in the same way, usage of special tools for this purpose is better in my opininon.

Because it is very different development way then ever before I also expect some differencies in methods of applications using or providing _RESTful API_s. I will find these differencies in this thesis and I will also find some similarities in field of regular software testing and _RESTful API_ testing because I see it as not so well known field in which many differencies and surprising similarities can be found. 

I also will compare various exist tools which supports testing of _RESTful API_s and find out some of their disadvantages or strengths. Based on this knowledge I can decide which testing tool is the best for testing own _RESTful API_. At the end I will choose one tool which I will try to update for better usage to show my results in real.
